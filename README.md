I created this fully functional app using Claude and ChatGPT!

**IMPORTANT NOTES**

If you wish to use this application please be aware of the following:
1. You may swipe down on the playback UI activity to refresh the UI. You need to do this whenever the UI is incorrect (when you leave and return to the app).
2. Do not spam-click the play/stop button. This can cause unwanted behavior.
3. To access the notification widget, you need to go to App Permissions in Settings and allow notifications.
4. The playback will not stop if you start playing a different media source, or get a phone call.
5. Your phone may occasionally send you a notification stating that the app keeps crashing. Do not worry about it.

I could have done more work to improve the app, but it works well enough for my use cases. I am open to reworking on it someday, however :)
